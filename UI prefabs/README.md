# UI Prefabs

These are the Unity prefab files for ComponentUtil. If you want to change them you can load them into Unity, build the AssetBundle, rename it to `componentutil.unity3d` and overwrite the file at `RSkoi_ComponentUtil.Shared/Resources/componentutil.unity3d`. By default the AssetBundle is `studio/rskoi/componentutil`.
